          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          var has a global or function scope, leading to potential variable
          hoisting and redeclaration issues.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-lg">
          let and const have block-level scope, limiting their accessibility to
          the nearest enclosing block.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-lg">
          let allows variable reassignment, while const enforces immutability,
          making it suitable for constants. These scoping rules improve code
          predictability and maintainability.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined

        <p>
          <li>
            <span>Explicit Absence of Value:</span> It is used to explicitly
            indicate the absence of a value or that a variable intentionally has
            no value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clearing Object Properties: Developers can set an object property to
            null to indicate that it should be considered empty or no longer in
            use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Comparison: null is often used when comparing or checking for the
            absence of an object or value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garbage Collection: In some memory management scenarios, setting a
            reference to null can help in releasing memory resources by
            indicating that an object is no longer needed
          </li>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="text-xl">1.Undefined</h3>
        <p>
          <li>
            Default Initial Value: When a variable is declared but not
            initialized, it is assigned the value undefined by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Function Parameters: If a function is called with fewer arguments
            than declared parameters, the missing parameters are set to
            undefined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Object Properties: If you try to access an object property that
            doesn't exist, the result is undefined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return Value: Functions that don't explicitly return a value return
            undefined
          </li>

      <p class="text-lg">
        REST (Representational State Transfer) API, is a set of architectural
        constraints and principles for designing networked applications. It uses
        HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read,
        Update, Delete) operations on resources represented as URLs. REST APIs
        are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must
        contain all the information needed to understand and process the
        request, and they typically return responses in JSON or XML format.
        RESTful APIs are widely used for web services and provide a scalable,
        simple, and standardized way for different software systems to
        communicate with each other over the internet.
